## General info
This project is a web application about improving the financial situation of low income classes. The website can be found at https://leren-budgetteren.web.app/.

## Mission
'Leren Budgetteren' is the company making a difference in the growing wealth gap. Every day we work towards a better future for everyone. We do this by giving people a clear picture of their current financial state and creating more financial awareness in an educational manner. Investing is no longer just for the rich. This way, they handle the money better, earn more money and create a bright future for them and their descendants.

## Technology
The web application is made with React.js, a javascript based framework created by Facebook. Google's Firebase is used for the back-end. In this way a serverless application can be created. This not only ensures that the development process can be accelerated, it also ensures that the project is scalable.

## Setup
To run the web application on your own computer's localhost, there are a few steps you need to take (assuming your computer already has Node.js). First of all, the dependencies from the package.json must be installed by npm. This can be done by running the following command in the root directory.
```
npm install
```
In addition, a file must also be created for the environment variable. This is where the Firebase api keys are placed. When this is done, the application can be started. This can be done with the following command from the root directory.
```
npm start
```
