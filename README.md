## General info
This product stems from a first years Information science project. In total 7 students have worked together on this assignment under the supervision of Gizem. Leren Budgetteren is a web application focussed on improving the financial situation of people from lower income classes. This is done by providing a platform to track your expenses that allows the user to see how much money they really have available to spend. Furthermore, users can learn from selected literature that focusses on improving financial conditions of people from lower income classes. This is especially helpfull to get a deeper understanding of what is causing people to have lower incomes and, more importantly, how to get out of such a situation. Lastly users can track investments they made from inside the app, this allowes users to have their full financial overview packed together on one web-application. The website can be found at https://leren-budgetteren.web.app/.


## Mission
'Leren Budgetteren' is the company making a difference in the growing wealth gap. Every day we work towards a better future for everyone. We do this by giving people a clear picture of their current financial state and creating more financial awareness in an educational manner. Investing is no longer just for the rich. This way, people handle their money more effectively, earn more money and create a brighter future for themselves and their children.

## Technology
The web application is created with React.js, a javascript based framework developed by Facebook. Google's Firebase is used for the back-end. In this way a serverless application can be created. This not only ensures that the development process can be accelerated, it also ensures that the project is scalable.

## Setup
To run the web application on your own computer's localhost, there are a few steps you need to take (assuming your computer already has Node.js). First of all, the dependencies from the package.json must be installed by npm. This can be done by running the following command in the root directory.
```
npm install
```
In addition, a file must also be created for the environment variable. This is where the Firebase api keys are placed. When this is done, the application can be started. This can be done with the following command from the root directory.
```
npm start
```

The team who developed this webapplication are:
* Sjoed Vink
